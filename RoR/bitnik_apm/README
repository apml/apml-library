BitnikApm
=========

Bitnik APM is a Ruby on Rails plugin that offers the next APM functionality for a rails application:

- Support for defining attention destinies from application models, later exposed as APML concepts.
- Support for defining attention sources from application models.
- The plugin offers methods that allow a defined attention source to give attention values to the defined concepts, later exposed as APML "value" attributes.
- Support for defining attention destiny references, identified by an external URL, later transleted into APML sources.
- APML files writer.
- APML files parser.

Installation
============

Copy the plugin to your RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins directory and run:

$script/generate bitnik_apm setup

Run the migrations script:

$rake db:migrate

Now you are ready to use the plugin.


Examples
=======

-Defining a model to be an AttentionSource:

class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as attention_source
end

-Defining a model to be an AttentionDestiny, with the value provided by
the attribute/method model_key_method for the APML key attribute of the concept element:

class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_attention_destiny :key_mapping => 'model_key_method'

  def model_key_method
    "test_key"
  end
end

-Giving attention values to an AttentionDestiny:

attention_source.pay_attention_to(destiny, 20, :implicit)
attention_source.pay_explicit_attention_to(destiny_2,12)

-Generating the APML file for a given AttentionSource object:

class ApmCalculator
  def compute_attention(concept,mode,value,total_attention_value)
    #algorithm here
  end
end
attention_source.to_apml(:calculator => ApmCalculator.new, :test => "test")

-Parsing a APML file:

doc = ApmlDocument.new(StringIO.new(" xml here ")
doc.profiles["home"].implicit_concepts["tv"].value


Tests
=====

To pass the plugin tests, you must firstly setup some test models. You can set up these
models using the following generator:

$script/generator bitnik_apm test_infraestructure

Run the migrations:

$rake db:migrate

Now, you can pass the tests:

$ rake test:plugins

If you want to clean your app your installation after passing the tests, you cant  migrate
the DB to the prior version and delete the generated migration:

$ rake db:migrate VERSION N-1
$ rm db/migrate/xxx_create_apm_test_infraestructure
